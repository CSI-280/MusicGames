        * Some sort of database to track users.
	* https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/install/
    * React
        * Frontend.
        * Everything rendered on the screen will be done using React.

## APIs
With this project, we will be using a number of APIs:
   * [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/api/)
        * Last.fm is a tool that tracks your music, and can provide recommendations based on artists that you listen to.
	* It has a ton a data that will be useful for this project.
    * [Bandsintown](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Bandsintown/PublicAPI/3.0.0#/)
        * Bandsintown is a tool that provides an artists events.
        * Artist Info: returns the link to the Bandsintown artist page, the link to the artist photo, the current number of trackers and more.
        * Artist Events: returns the list of events including their date and time, venue name and location, ticket links, lineup, description and the link to the Bandsintown event page.
    * [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)
        * It's Spotify. This is what we're going to use to playback music.
        * We will have one master account that will be used to playback songs. 
	* The account will also hold the playlist for the site.
    * [Dictionary](https://dictionaryapi.com/)
        * This API will be used for one of the sites extra features, breaking down songs word by word, using the dictionary definition.

We will likely be using more APIs as this project grows, but these are the ones that we know we are going to use.
